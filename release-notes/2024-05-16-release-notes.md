### External (Data Studio Only)

**New Table:**

A Uniswap project, Token Lists, is a community-led initiative to improve discoverability, reputation and trust in ERC20 token lists in a manner that is inclusive, transparent, and decentralized. This table contains dimensional information about the tokens listed on [https://tokenlists.org/](https://tokenlists.org/). This EZ view joins in Defillama's dim\_chains for additional chain metadata.

### [NEAR](https://flipsidecrypto.github.io/near-models/#!/overview)

**New Table:**

This table records all the NFT sales actions on the main Near marketplaces.

### [Solana](https://flipsidecrypto.github.io/solana-models/#!/overview)

**New Table:**

This table enables easier analysis of Meteora, one of the largest platforms for providing liquidity. The newly added data includes any actions involving the deposit and withdrawal of tokens, as well as related mints and burns of LP tokens.
