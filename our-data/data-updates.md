# Data Updates

## **For More information on new databases and three part naming, please see** [**this document**](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1swYTBHYNoY27Mz5FB2Ru0KNTLRhwX6imWQtlyW5F-7Q/edit)****

**Solana Schema**

Solana will be have its own database starting early June 2022! We will move it from

flipside\_prod\_db --> solana

Your queries and dashboards will continue to work for a period of time. To future proof your dashboards, you should move over **all work** to the three part naming convention in the new solana database.&#x20;

****

**Ethereum Schema**

**Ethereum will have its own database starting May 25, 2022! flipside\_prod\_db.ethereum\_core will still be supported until June. We are actively making infrastructure upgrades and it will replace both flipside\_prod\_db.ethereum and ethereum\_core.**&#x20;

New Ethereum tables will be released in April 2022!

The new Ethereum schema will be **ethereum\_core**. Ethereum was one of the first blockchains that was developed within Flipside and there have been upgrades to infrastructure, warehousing, model building, etc. The Flipside developers have been working on what is being called the Ethereum facelift where many of the tables have been re-built from the ground up taking into account user feedback, usage, and lessons learned.&#x20;

Timeline:\
\- April 18, 2022 - Eth Week! New Schema exposed for all users. All bounties will have to use ethereum\_core schema.\
