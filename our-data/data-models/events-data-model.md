# UDM Events Model

An event in Flipside's data model represents the distillation of all interactions that occur within a transaction. An event could range from a simple transfer between two parties to more complex smart contract calls.

## UDM Event Model

The event model is represented for each chain as a single table. For example _"_"_ethereum.udm\_events_". The event model can conceptually be broken down into 2 core components, **parent context data** corresponding to the event and the **event data** itself.

### Parent Context Data

Depending on the chain, a single transaction may consist of several "child" events.

To consistently represent the 1-to-many relationship, you will see 1 row that represents each transaction (including the fee for issuing the transaction) and then 1 or more rows representing all other events that are generated by this transaction.

All of these rows are grouped by their parent transaction metadata:

#### Block Context:

The following block-level metadata allows for block-level grouping of events.

| Field            |                                             |
| ---------------- | ------------------------------------------- |
| block\_timestamp | UTC timestamp when the block was confirmed. |
| block\_number    | The block height.                           |

#### Transaction Context:

| Field        |                                                                                                                                                                                                 |
| ------------ | ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| tx\_id       | A unique identifier of the transaction, typically a transaction hash.                                                                                                                           |
| tx\_type     | Transaction type is used to distinguish the top-level transaction type, e.g. reward distribution, delegation, validator creation, or any smart contract function call on a chain like Ethereum. |
| tx\_from     | The address that initiated the transaction.                                                                                                                                                     |
| tx\_to       | The address of the transaction recipient.                                                                                                                                                       |
| tx\_fee      | The decimal adjusted fee associated with the transaction.                                                                                                                                       |
| tx\_fee\_usd | The USD equivalent value of fee at transaction time.                                                                                                                                            |

{% hint style="info" %}
When you are looking at more complicated behaviors, you may want to filter by particular tx\_type first, then look at the "child" events for all transactions in this subset.
{% endhint %}

{% hint style="warning" %}
Note: On Ethereum, the tx data is broken out into its own separate table. All other chains follow a 1 table rule for the Events data model. Check-out the specific Ethereum documentation for more details there.&#x20;

### Event Data

| Field              | Description                                                                                                                                        |

| event\_type        | The type of event, specific to each blockchain, for example,  "transfer", "reward", "stake", "mint", etc.                                          |
| event\_currency    | If applicable, the on-chain asset involved in the event.                                                                                           |
| event\_amount      | If applicable, the decimal adjusted amount involved in the event (this is typically present when the event\_type is a "transfer")                  |
| event\_amount\_usd | If applicable, the USD equivalent value sent at transaction time (this is typically present when a market exists for the event\_currency involved) |
