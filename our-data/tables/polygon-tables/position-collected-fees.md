# Position Collected Fees

Fees collected by a Liquidity Provider (LP) on their position. In V3 fees are accrued and collected in each token within the pair. When a pool `Collect` event is emitted a new record is appended to this table. If a `Burn` event is emitted in the same transaction as the `Collect` event the amount of the burn is subtracted from the `Collect` event token1 and token0 amounts. This allows us to arrive solely at the swap fees collected.
