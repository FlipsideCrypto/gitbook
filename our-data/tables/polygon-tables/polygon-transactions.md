# Polygon Transactions

{% hint style="warning" %}
These are legacy Polygon tables. See [Polygon 2.0](../polygon-2.0-tables.md) for up-to-date Polygon models.
{% endhint %}

Polygon transactions exist within the polygon schema, as `polygon.transactions` .

Transactions contain top-level summary information not found in `polygon.udm_events`, for example, transaction fees and gas.
