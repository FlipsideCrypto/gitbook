# Ethereum DEX Tables

{% hint style="warning" %}
These legacy Ethereum tables are deprecated. See [Ethereum Core](../../ethereum-core-tables/) for up-to-date Ethereum models.
{% endhint %}

The ethereum DEX tables presently cover Uniswap and Sushiswap, with more DEXes planned to be added over time. Compared to project specific tables such as Uniswap V3, these are the more general tables that cover a wider variety of protocols -- so Uniswap V3 pools will be in DEX Liquidity pools but much more specific information on the V3 pools will be available in uniswapv3.pools compared to here.
