| `event_platform`   | string    | the platform where the event took place, eg. a hashmask sold on opensea would be event\_platform = 'opensea'                                                                                                                                                                                                         |

| `event_type`       | string    | mint / list / unlist / sale / transfer - this is the Flipside event name NOT the event name that you might find on etherscan or in the raw data                                                                                                                                                                      |

| `project_name`     | string    | the name of the contract address (can be the same or different from the event\_platform)                                                                                                                                                                                                                             |
| `token_id`         | number    | the token id of the NFT                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                              |
| `event_from`       | address   | not necessarily the "from" that you would find on etherscan, for example if a contract held the NFT during an auction, we will not put that holder contract in as the "from" in a sale, but we'll use the actual seller, even if we have to go to another transaction to find the seller                             |
| `event_to`         | address   | the buyer of a sale, recipient of a mint event, or a contract that holds an NFT while it is being auctioned / for sale / etc.                                                                                                                                                                                        |
| `price`            | number    | the total price paid by the purchaser for sale events, or the list price for list events. Note that when several NFT's are sold in the same transaction but only one price is paid, we represent the "paid" amount for each NFT sold as the total price paid in the transaction divided by the number of NFT's sold. |
| `price_usd`        | number    | price at the time of the transaction converted to USD                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                |
| `platform_fee`     | number    | the fee, which is a portion of price, that went to the event\_platform. Note that if the previous owner of the NFT was the platform itself (e.g. hashmasks mints, or crypto kitties gen 0 sales), then price could be equal to platform\_fee                                                                         |
| `creator_fee`      | number    | the fee, which is a portion of price, that went to the creator (only applicable to art NFT's). Note that if the previous owner of the NFT was the creator (i.e. first sale after minting), then price could be equal to creator\_fee                                                                                 |
| `tx_currency`      | string    | the symbol of the currency of the transaction                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                        |
