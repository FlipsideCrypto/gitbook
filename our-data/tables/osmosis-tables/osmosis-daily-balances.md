# Osmosis Daily Balances

### Table Schema

`osmosis.daily_balances`

This table is currently under development and will release in the Velocity App soon. This table only includes balances for addresses that are actively staking or providing liquidity to a liquidity pool. If an address is not doing either of these actions on a given date, it will not be represented in the table on that date.&#x20;
