# Osmosis Tables

### Background of Osmosis

**Blockchain:** [Osmosis](https://app.osmosis.zone/)

Osmosis is a proof-of-stake IBC blockchain with a decentralized exchange application enabling users to provide liquidity, swap, and stake tokens from across the Cosmos ecosystem. The Osmosis Frontier application, which is a full permissionless listing and curation of bridged ETH and CW20 assets, exists alongside the main Osmosis application.&#x20;

The native token of Osmosis, Osmo, is used for governance and paying transaction fees for actions performed on the DEX. There are a few points that make Osmosis a unique DEX:

* **Self-Governing Liquidity Pools:** In Osmosis, the LP shares are used to calculate the fractional ownership of a LP, as well as the right to participate in the strategic decision making of the LP via governance. To incentivize long-term liquidity commitment, shares must be locked up for an extended period. Longer-term commitments are awarded by additional voting power and additional liquidity mining revenue.
* **Superfluid Staking:** A method of staking the OSMO tokens that underlie your LP positions to earn additional rewards. Superfluid staking is at time of writing only available on certain OSMO pools on Osmosis.
* **MEV Resistance:** Osmosis was conceived with the goal of Maximal Extractable Value (MEV) resistance at its core and includes several unique solutions to help limit MEV.

### Current Osmosis Tables

The Osmosis tables are built on Osmosis transaction and messages information.&#x20;
