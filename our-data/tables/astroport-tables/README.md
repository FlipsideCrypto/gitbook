# Astroport Tables

Astroport is an automated market-maker (AMM) protocol on the Terra blockchain.&#x20;

From [Astroport's docs](https://docs.astroport.fi/astroport/astroport-onboarding/the-impact) : "Astroport is a next-generation AMM for Terra that was built to improve pricing and trade efficiency. Better pricing and efficiency should help Astroport attract more liquidity, further improving pricing and efficiency in a self-reinforcing loop. That is key, as trade efficiency is what ultimately drives adoption and integration with other protocols."
