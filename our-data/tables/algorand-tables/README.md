# Algorand Tables

The Algorand tables schema are based on the [Algorand indexer](https://github.com/algorand/indexer/releases/tag/2.8.0). Algorand tables are available in Velocity as the `algorand` schema. The tables are built based on the algorand asset, app, account,  block, and transaction information.

At Flipside, we currently offer raw tables based on the Algorand indexer with the exception of transactions broken into separate tables based on transaction type. Click the following link to learn more about the tables. We will be continuing to add further curated tables of Algorand data so check back intermittently to learn about the additional tables that have been added.
