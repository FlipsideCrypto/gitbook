# Asset Configuration Transaction

This is a table for all transactions whose type is Asset Configuration. These transactions are to create, configure and destroy an asset depending on which fields are set. For more details on asset configuration transactions. Visit here: [ ](https://developer.algorand.org/docs/get-details/transactions/transactions/#asset-configuration-transaction)[https://developer.algorand.org/docs/get-details/transactions/transactions/#asset-configuration-transaction](https://developer.algorand.org/docs/get-details/transactions/transactions/#asset-configuration-transaction)

## Table Schema

All transactions have a distinct intra and block\_id combination. The intra is the transaction # into the block where the transaction was confirmed. Inner transactions(flagged with the inner tx flag) share the tx id of their parent application transactions so you can tie inner transaction to a parent transaction via a tx id. The inner transactions are seen as distinct transactions on the Algorand blockchain, which is signified by their intra and block id combination. One other note on the parent transactions, the parent transaction of inner transaction do not summarize the inner transactions and are seen as their own distinct transaction, which is usually an application call transaction.&#x20;
