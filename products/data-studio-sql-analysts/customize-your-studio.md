# Customize your Studio

Your workspace should fit your flow, and your profile should represent you professionally. We designed Flipside to be customizable, so you can make it yours - here are a few ways you can do just that:

* [Customize your workspace](customize-your-studio.md#customize-your-workspace)
* [Organize "My Work"](customize-your-studio.md#organize-my-work)
* [Customize your profile](customize-your-studio.md#customize-your-profile)&#x20;

***

## Customize your workspace

Your Studio is where you‚Äôll spend the most time, so it‚Äôs important to make it your own!&#x20;

In the query editor at [flipside.new](http://flipside.new/), there are several ways you can customize your workspace:

* Click & drag walls between panels to resize them
* Double-click to maximize panels
* Expand/Collapse with the minimize button in the top right corner of panels
* Toggle dark mode in the settings menu

You can resize all of these panels to your heart‚Äôs content (and in dark mode!).&#x20;

## Organize ‚ÄúMy Work‚Äù

The ‚ÄúMy Work‚Äù section (folder icon) in the left-hand menu is also customizable, so you never have to dig through a cluttered query history to duplicate or go over old work.

Under My Work, you can create a query, a dashboard, or a collection of several of either. To organize your new creation, you have a few options:

1. **Create collections:**\
   To organize your work, create a collection. Simply click the "+" button and choose a name. (Collections will always live on the top of "My Work").
2. **Drag and Drop:**\
   To move a file, simply drag and drop that file to the desired location in the file tree.
3. **Multi-Select:**\
   To move multiple files at once, ctrl+shift (cmd+shift on Mac) and click to select the files you want to move, then drag and drop them to the desired location in the file tree.&#x20;

Then, simply use the search bar and ‚Äúsort by‚Äù function to conveniently keep your space clean!

## Customize your profile

Think of your Flipside profile as your professional analysis portfolio. The dashboards you create will be collected under your profile, giving you one central body of work.
