# Getting Started

Welcome to Flipside!

Flipside makes it easy to build tools and products, create shareable dashboards, and generate market insights with onchain data.&#x20;

You're about to get access to labeled, tagged, and human-readable data on the top 26 chains & protocols (and we’re always adding more) so you can build with and query data, however and whenever you need it.

All you need to get started is a free account:

## Create your account

### Click "Sign up"

At flipsidecrypto.xyz, the blue sign up button is in the top right corner. Or, you can just click [this link](https://login.flipsidecrypto.xyz/u/signup?state=hKFo2SBucFc4LVRsWHRON29pV3F2aHE4UmV5eFh4MEt6YWxhZKFur3VuaXZlcnNhbC1sb2dpbqN0aWTZIG1ibHVHdl9OcTk1T0NzTllsWkMzUkNXODVEOWZmZ21io2NpZNkgV0U3NUl3aVA0ejlxU0kzUjBzQ1FzU2tjVWxSRHY5RUo).

Then, choose a username and password to associate with your email address. Or, sign up with your Discord account!

Now that you're signed up, you can choose to visit the Studio or get access to the API:&#x20;

### Access your Studio

_In the Studio, you can write queries, create charts, and build shareable insights dashboards._

From the home page, you can access your Studio interface with the link in the header. (We’ll walk through Discover, LiveQuery, Earn, and more in future tutorials).

Or, type [https://flipside.new](https://flipside.new) into your search engine to go to your Studio and auto-populate a new query in the SQL editor!



### Access the API

_With the API, you can query data programmatically and conveniently build it into your apps/protocols._&#x20;

To create your API key, click "API" in the header. This is where your keys will be stored, as well as where you can track your usage and upgrade your plan.

To help your products get off the ground, we're giving 5,000 free query seconds to all Flipside users every month!
