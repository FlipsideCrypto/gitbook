{% hint style="info" %}
This program has been adjusted to [Top 30 for November 2023](top-8-dashboard-rewards.md).

Top 8 is Flipside's dashboard rewards program. **Please note: this program is in Beta testing, and is subject to change!** [Read the announcement](https://twitter.com/flipsidecrypto/status/1636035565803155457?s=20) for more details_._

TLDR; make dashboards in our app, publish and promote them, and if your dashboard spends time in the Top 8 (the first eight spots on our [homepage](https://flipsidecrypto.xyz/)) you get paid.&#x20;

Here's how it works:

The trending dashboard rankings on our [homepage](https://flipsidecrypto.xyz/) are based on:

👍 likes on our website\
📈 social media engagement and shares across various platforms\
👀 views/website engagement\
🌐 shares across the web\
🤫 other factors

Basically, If you make a dashboard that resonates with people, it has a chance to rise to the Top 8 trending dashboards on the site. When that happens we keep track of it, and every Wednesday, we tally up time-spent in the Top 8 per dashboard, and dole out the rewards accordingly.

Rewards are currently pegged at: $1 for every hour your board is in the Top 8.&#x20;

Flipside staff will reach out to winners directly. Please feel free to reach out in [Discord](https://discord.gg/ZmU3jQuu6W) if you have any questions.

We will continue to evolve this program over time — to keep up with the latest developments, or if you're looking for more ways to earn, level up, or build a following, follow us on Twitter: [@flipsidecrypto](https://twitter.com/flipsidecrypto).
