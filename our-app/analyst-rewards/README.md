### Ambassador Program

Ambassadors are data storytellers who specialize in one or more chains, and serve those chain’s communities with relevant data created on Flipside. You’ll become a trusted and helpful source of insight in your community, giving you the chance to spread the word about the importance and accessibility of data to your ecosystem.

_**How to get started:**_

Submit stellar dashboards. And get to know our team in our [Discord](https://discord.gg/ZmU3jQuu6W) so we can get to know you. We’ll reach out when we see you’re a go-to ecosystem expert.



### Direct to Analyst Commissions

When specific questions, problems or projects pop up, we ask the community for help. These are big, one-off challenges with a big pay-off. Just keep honing your craft, and we’ll help you with the connections.

_**How to get started:**_

Make great work. Our team is always scanning dashboards to find hidden talent. Drop us a message in [Discord](https://discord.gg/ZmU3jQuu6W), let us know what chain you’re an expert in.



### Introducing: Analyst Tournaments

Tournaments are March-Madness-style bracket tournaments. Go head to head with other analysts - the best dashboards move on in the competition. Tens of thousands of dollars are up for grabs in each tournament.

_**How to get started:**_

Follow us on [Twitter](https://twitter.com/flipsidecrypto) for tournament announcements and registration. Pro tip: we may start whitelisting tournaments, with a priority given to analysts who have had dashboards ranked in the Top 40 on Flipside. Happy querying.
