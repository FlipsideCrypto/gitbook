# üÉè Game Rules

Welcome to **Grail**, a new type of on-chain game launching first on Aptos. Harness your tokens, strategic insight, and a dash of luck to vie for a part of the $100,000 prize pool.&#x20;

### Objective

Your primary goal is to amass the maximum points by the game's conclusion to earn a substantial share of the $100k prize pool. Points are gained through various activities within the Aptos ecosystem, each with its own strategic benefits and implications.

### **Game Timeline**

* **Start Date:** Monday, May 6th, 2024, at 2 p.m. ET
* **End Date:** Thursday, May 31st, 2024, at 11:59 p.m. ET

## Earning Points

### 1. Bridging Capital

The primary method to earn points is by bridging tokens into Aptos (including ETH, USDC, USDT, BTC, CAKE, and WETH). Points accrue per second based on the USD value of the tokens at the time you bridge them. When you unbridge tokens, your point accumulation decreases/ceases.

Allowed tokens:

* WETH
* ETH
* USDC
* USDT
* BTC
* CAKE

{% hint style="danger" %}
If you attempt to "cycle" assets you will be banned.
{% endhint %}

### 2. Multiplier Quests

Completing Multiplier Quests will earn you multipliers that can be applied to the base points you're earning from bridging capital.

This is crucial for enhancing the earning power of your points, especially if the amount of capital you can bridge is limited. These multipliers can significantly boost your score, helping to balance the playing field between players with varying levels of capital.

{% hint style="info" %}
&#x20;New Multiplier Quests will drop throughout the game. We have partnered with 12 different protocols in the Aptos ecosystem to power these Multiplier Quests.
{% endhint %}

#### **Building Your Deck**

Every Multiplier Quest you complete will add a multiplier to your deck of collected multipliers.

_For example, if a Multiplier Quest says "Liquid Stake on Amnis," after you stake on Amnis, Grail will automatically register the Multiplier Quest as completed, and a multiplier will be revealed. This multiplier is then added to your deck of collected multipliers._

* **Collection:** Each quest completed adds a multiplier to your deck. The value of these multipliers is unknown until collected and can vary significantly, adding a layer of strategy and uncertainty.
* **Strategic Deck Management:** Since multipliers' values can range from minimal to substantial, strategically selecting Multiplier Quests to complete is essential. Adding too many low-value multipliers could dilute your deck's effectiveness, especially if high-value multipliers are already present in your deck. On the flipside, you might be missing an opportunity for a monster multiplier.

{% hint style="info" %}
You may only collect a multiplier after it has been revealed. For example, if the multiplier quest is "_Lend on Aries_", only lending actions that occur after the multiplier quest has been revealed will qualify.
{% endhint %}

#### **Multiplier Variability**

After you have completed the on-chain action associated with the Multiplier Quest a multiplier value is revealed to you and added to your deck of collected multipliers.&#x20;

Multipliers come in various forms and strengths. Some may offer a modest increase in points, while others can provide a significant surge, propelling you ahead of competitors.

The revealed multiplier value can vary significantly and depends on a number of factors:&#x20;

* The amount of capital you have committed to the on-chain action relative to the amount of capital you have bridged
* Your current rank in the game
* And of course a bit of luck

**Tactical Considerations:** Players must decide whether to pursue additional multipliers or rely on their existing deck, weighing the potential benefits against the risk of diluting their deck with low-value multipliers.

#### **Drawing from Your Deck**

To start utilizing your deck, you must first collect a minimum of three multipliers. Each day, you can draw one multiplier at random from your deck to apply to your points per second earnings. This means:

* **Daily Draws:** You must return each day to draw a new multiplier, as your drawn multiplier is only active for 24 hours before it starts to decay.
* **Strategic Decisions:** Deciding when to complete quests and how to manage your deck composition becomes a critical part of your strategy.

{% hint style="info" %}
Your collected multipliers are recycled throughout the game. For example, an active multiplier will return to your deck after it has been used and will be eligible to be drawn again. &#x20;
{% endhint %}

{% hint style="danger" %}
After 24 hours your active multiplier will begin decaying. You must return to draw a new multiplier from your deck to ensure you have a fully powered active multiplier at any given time.
{% endhint %}

#### **Quest Instructions**

Quest instructions are intentionally vague, such as "_Peg on Thala._" These quests require you to use your skills, curiosity, and understanding of the Aptos ecosystem to complete them successfully.&#x20;

### 3. Inviting Friends

Expand your influence and earning potential by inviting friends to join Grail. When you enroll in the Grail game you will receive a special invite link that can be used to invite your friends.

* **Bonus Points:** Earn 2% of the base points (excluding multipliers or additional invite bonuses) that your friends accumulate. Base points are earned for bridging capital into the Aptos ecosystem and completing Multiplier Quests. Base points exclude points someone might earn from inviting others.

{% hint style="warning" %}
To qualify for invite points, you must maintain your balance of bridged capital for the duration of the game. Bridging in, inviting a friend, and bridging out will disqualify you from earning invite rewards.
{% endhint %}

## Strategic Considerations

* **Capital Management:** Keep your tokens bridged as long as possible to maximize continuous point accumulation.
* **Deck Strategy:** Be selective about the Multiplier Quests you undertake to optimize the quality of Multipliers in your deck.
* **Community Engagement:** Regularly invite friends to join the game to boost your passive point earnings.
