# ðŸ¥‡ Leaderboard & Rewards

### Leveling Up

There are two benefits to leveling up throughout the game:

1. Higher guaranteed minimum payouts
2. Access to a much more substantial lottery payout. The number of lottery winners varies by level (the more people in the level, the more lottery winners; see the table above for more details).

### Announcing Winners

At the conclusion of the game, a one-week review period will take place. The Flipside team will review the rankings to ensure no rules were violated. Any players who violate the rules or behave in a manner not in the spirit of the game will be disqualified.&#x20;

We will then conduct the lottery at each level and winners will be announced and revealed on the [leaderboard](https://flipsidecrypto.xyz/grail/aptos/s1/leaderboard).&#x20;

### Payouts

After the final winners have been announced, payouts will be available to all players for withdrawal in the [Flipside Reward Center](https://flipsidecrypto.xyz/earn).&#x20;
