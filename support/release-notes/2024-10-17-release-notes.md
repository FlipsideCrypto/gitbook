# 2024-10-17 | Release Notes

## Highlights

This release introduces new tables for Blast and Eclipse, allowing users to track DEX swaps, liquidity pools, and token mint and burn events. A new Sei table enables analysts to map Sei cosmos addresses to Sei EVM addresses, while Solana's updated swaps table now includes Raydium CPMM swaps.

{% hint style="warning" %}
**As a reminder** several Ethereum and Optimism lending tables were deprecated on October 12th, 2024, with their data consolidated into the DeFi schema. These updates improve tracking and analysis across multiple blockchains.
