# 2024-12-24 | Release Notes

## Highlights

As we wrap up 2024, we're excited to bring you some holiday gifts in the form of new data! This festive release introduces new tables across multiple chains, including Aleo's DeFi tables, expanded bridge tracking on Blast, and a more intuitive NEAR table schema. We're also spreading some holiday cheer with THORChain affiliate fee tracking.

{% hint style="warning" %}
**Important Update for NEAR Users**: Two tables are being phased out in favor of our new streamlined `core.ez_actions` table. Please migrate your queries by January 30, 2025, to ensure a smooth transition into the new year.
