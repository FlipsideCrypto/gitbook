### Platform Updates

#### EVM Standardization Initiative Complete

We're excited to announce the completion of our comprehensive EVM standardization project, a multi-month initiative that has transformed how blockchain data is structured and accessed across all EVM-compatible chains in Flipside.

This standardization ensures consistent data models, naming conventions, and schema structures across Ethereum, Polygon, Arbitrum, Optimism, Avalanche C-Chain, and all other EVM networks. The result is a more intuitive, reliable experience for analysts working with multi-chain data.

**Key Benefits:**

* Unified data models across all EVM chains
* Consistent table structures and naming conventions
* Improved query performance and reliability
* Enhanced cross-chain analysis capabilities

### Documentation & Resources

#### Solana Swaps Analysis Guide

Solana's extensive use of aggregators like Jupiter creates unique challenges for swap data analysis. To help analysts navigate this complexity, we've released comprehensive documentation that demystifies Flipside's multi-table design for Solana swaps.

**New Resources Available:**

* [**Documentation Guide**](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1gxU7Q8BNf2w6xsDIczfxxOFMPM0ujQSJTzwGPDkZTVU/edit?tab=t.0): In-depth explanation of Solana's swap data architecture and table relationships
* [**Video Tutorial**](https://www.loom.com/share/f20d1f54b63342eea6457381be7175a1?sid=589f65ec-505a-446c-b249-19e6a9b9a6fb): Step-by-step walkthrough of extracting meaningful insights from Solana swap data

These resources illuminate how to effectively query across multiple tables to capture the full picture of Solana's decentralized exchange activity, from direct swaps to complex multi-hop transactions through various aggregation protocols.
