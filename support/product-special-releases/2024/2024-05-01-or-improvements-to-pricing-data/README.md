{% endhint %}

Exciting times at Flipside as we turbocharge our pricing data offerings! Some actions are needed. Here's what's new:

* **Pricing data on more tokens:** Weâ€™ve expanded our token coverage to include pricing data from CoinGecko for more than 15,000 tokens. You read that right > FIFTEEN THOUSAND tokens ðŸ¤¯
* **Pricing data optimization:** We've switched from daily to hourly updates of all token prices! Plus, we've added native token pricing alongside our existing wrapped token pricing and enriched our database with pricing data dating back to 2018. Weâ€™ve got improved coverage on all fronts.
* **Refreshing our tables:** We're cleaning house by phasing out older pricing tables and introducing more efficient versions.

These updates ensure that Flipside remains your go-to source for precise and comprehensive blockchain data analytics.
