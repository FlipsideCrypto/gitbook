# 2025-06-20 | Deprecating Studio, Dashboards, API, SDK

To fully embody our mission of building a future of sustainable blockchain growth, we are focusing all efforts on providing products and services that help realize this mission.&#x20;

## Summary

On July 1, 2025, we are sunsetting the dashboard and analyst tools: Studio, Dashboard Builder, API, and SDK.&#x20;

We invite you to [query or export](https://app.snowflake.com/marketplace/data-products/search?search=flipside+core\&pricing=free\&provider=%22GZT0ZJKG5N9%22) free Flipside core data on Snowflake (receive a [$400 Snowflake credit](https://signup.snowflake.com/?owner=SPN-PID-386521) with a free trial).&#x20;

Plus, a new AI-powered toolkit for discovering insights is [now available in beta](https://flipsidecrypto.xyz/fc/flipside-mcp-interest): the Flipside Growth MCP.&#x20;

## Product FAQ

### ❓ What products are deprecating?

Studio, Dashboards, API, and SDK.

### ❓Timeline: When will the deprecation happen?

**July 1, 2025**: Studio and dashboards become **read-only**. You can view your Studio account, view your work and others’ public work, but cannot run queries or create or edit dashboards. The API remains accessible until July 31 to aid migration.&#x20;

**July 14, 2025**: Autorefresh stops for queries that were set to autorefresh before July 1.

**July 31, 2025**: Studio, dashboards, and the API will no longer be available.

### ❓Will dashboard links still work?

Between July 1-31, public dashboards will remain visible (read-only). After July 31, dashboard links will no longer display dashboard content. They may redirect to a company page.

### ❓How can I back up my work?

Between July 1-31, you will find a button in Studio that enables you to **download a CSV file of all your SQL queries**. We recommend taking advantage of this feature to back up your work.

After July 31 it will still be possible to request a bulk download of your SQL queries for a period of time, processed manually.

For dashboards, we recommend the following backup methods: saving HTML/CSS files, Loom or screen recordings (especially for interactive dashboards with tabs or parameters), PDF, or another preferred method.

### ❓What about Flipside data?

You can continue to query **free** Flipside **core** data [directly on Snowflake](https://app.snowflake.com/marketplace/data-products/search?search=flipside+core\&pricing=free\&provider=%22GZT0ZJKG5N9%22). Flipside provides this data free of charge, but is not responsible for Snowflake costs.

### ❓What is the Growth MCP? Does it offer analytics?

Sign up for free beta access to the [Flipside Growth MCP](https://flipsidecrypto.xyz/fc/flipside-mcp-interest) (watch the [demo](https://x.com/flipsidecrypto/status/1934622498399863036)).&#x20;

The Growth MCP draws on Flipside data and proprietary user scores, enabling you to analyze onchain/offchain insights across 35+ chains and launch targeted growth campaigns in Claude, ChatGPT, or your LLM of choice.

### ❓How can I get user support? Who can I ask for product help?

The only official way to receive Flipside support is to [open a ticket](https://docs.flipsidecrypto.xyz/support/support) on our website. If you need more help on how to open a support ticket, please use [this guide](https://docs.flipsidecrypto.xyz/support/open-a-ticket).

### ❓Can I still report missing or incorrect data in the tables?

You can report missing or incorrect data in the Flipside Snowflake tables by [opening a ticket](https://docs.flipsidecrypto.xyz/support/support) on our website. You might not receive an individual status update on your report, but our commitment to the accuracy of the underlying data that fuels growth remains.

### ❓Can I still request ABI/IDLs for decoding?

Yes, we invite you to continue using ABI and IDL submission forms (please note you might not receive an individual status update on your request).

* Request a smart contract ABI to be decoded: [https://science.flipsidecrypto.xyz/abi-requestor/](https://science.flipsidecrypto.xyz/abi-requestor/)
* Request a Solana IDL to be decoded: [https://science.flipsidecrypto.xyz/idl-requestor](https://science.flipsidecrypto.xyz/idl-requestor)

## Community FAQ

### ❓Is the analyst community also sunsetting?

After July 1, Flipside will no longer operate the Discord community. The Discord may remain an independent community, but will not offer Flipside user support, company announcements, or a way to reach the Flipside team.&#x20;

### ❓What about the Ambassador Program?

The current version of the Ambassador Program is sunsetting on July 1.&#x20;

Thought leadership on insights-driven growth remains valuable. Please look to the [G² Growth Collective](https://t.me/gsquaredgrowth) for information about any future Flipside opportunities.
