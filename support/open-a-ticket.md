## Step 3: Click the Ticket Type that Relates to your Issue

There are 7 different ticket types to choose from.

<table><thead><tr><th width="228">Ticket Type</th><th>Description</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td><strong>Data Studio Issue</strong></td><td>Notice something wrong with the query editor or while building a dashboard? Let us know! Don’t forget to share a screenshot.</td></tr><tr><td><strong>Flipside Data Issue</strong></td><td>Something seems odd about the data in the tables? You see a transaction in the block explorer but not in our tables, or spot other missing values, or you expected a much higher or lower value than the result you got. You’ve checked out our <a href="https://docs.flipsidecrypto.com/data/flipside-data">table documentation</a>, <a href="https://docs.flipsidecrypto.com/data/flipside-data/table-freshness-targets">data freshness targets</a>, and troubleshooted your SQL – and something is still not quite right with the data tables. Reach out. Don’t forget to share a link to your SQL query that helped you discover this issue. </td></tr><tr><td><strong>Earn, Quest or Claiming Rewards Issue</strong></td><td>You can’t finish a quest. Your completed quest doesn’t get verified. You tried to claim your top dashboard earnings or other rewards and something did not work. You ran into a bug verifying your tax info. Use this ticket type to let us know what’s going on.</td></tr><tr><td><strong>API or SDK Issue</strong></td><td>You’re deep in the code and your API call keeps returning an error or maybe your API key isn’t working. Or you are using the Flipside SDK and experience an issue not described in our <a href="https://docs.flipsidecrypto.com/products/api-sdk-developers/get-started">SDK docs</a>.</td></tr><tr><td><strong>LiveQuery Issue</strong></td><td>Use this ticket type if you are having trouble with LiveQuery: a plugin isn’t working or authenticating, a query should return results from an external API but doesn’t, or something else isn’t right.</td></tr><tr><td><strong>Billing or Subscription Issue</strong></td><td>You signed up for Builder or Pro and you need help with changing your credit card or your bill seems off. </td></tr><tr><td><strong>Feature or Data Request</strong></td><td>Got an idea to make things more awesome? Give us a shout!</td></tr></tbody></table>
