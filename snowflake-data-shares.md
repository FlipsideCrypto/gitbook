# Snowflake Data Shares

Snowflake data shares gives you access to the entirety of Flipside's onchain databases in your own Snowflake environment.&#x20;

This is the best option for teams that want to incorporate large amount of historical data, near real-time data, or want to join Flipside's data with their own internal data, all without ever managing any node or complex pipelines.&#x20;

Flipside covers the cost of storage, and you only pay when you run a query (via Snowflake compute costs)&#x20;

If it happens on-chain, we've got it. We have related off-chain data, too.

Data includes core tables (blocks, events, transactions) for every chain, with added 'easy' tables (nfts, swaps, prices, etc.) and project-specific tables modeled by the Flipside community.&#x20;

We support 20+ blockchains and protocols. List here for documentation and public Github repos: [https://data.flipsidecrypto.com/data-shares](https://data.flipsidecrypto.com/data-shares)&#x20;
