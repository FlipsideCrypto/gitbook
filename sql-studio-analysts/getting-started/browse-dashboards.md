More than 60,000 analysts have published over 100,000 dashboards covering 26 protocols so far.

If you're looking for onchain insights, chances are you can find a board on the topic you're interested in! Maybe it contains the insights you're looking for, or maybe you can fork one of its queries to help you get started on your own dashboard.&#x20;

Either way, the process is easy!&#x20;

## 1. Visit the Discover page

Head to [flipsidecrypto.xyz/discover](https://flipsidecrypto.xyz/discover) or click the "discover more" button from the home page.&#x20;

_(You'll see trending dashboards from the home page, and can filter by chain, but you'll be able to search all dashboards from the Discover page.)_
