# Tax Center

Flipside has integrated [TaxBit](https://taxbit.com/) to make it easier for users to report their earnings.

Users of Flipside Earn that participate in programs including but not limited to Top 8, Top 30, Quests, Ambassadors, and Direct-to-Analyst requests are required to provide information required to generate a W9 or W8.

Learn more about these forms on the IRS website:

* [Form W-9](https://www.irs.gov/forms-pubs/about-form-w-9)
* [Form W-8BEN](https://www.irs.gov/forms-pubs/about-form-w-8-ben)
* [Form W-8BEN-E](https://www.irs.gov/forms-pubs/about-form-w-8-ben-e)&#x20;

Users of Flipside Earn will be able to continue to earn rewards but will not be able to claim rewards that put their yearly claims over $600 USD value without completing the required form.

Once information is verified with the IRS via TaxBit, the status will change to verified and the user can continue to claim rewards at will.

If information is invalid or the user wishes to assign the earnings to a different legal entity, the user may resubmit using the `Edit Tax Info` button.
