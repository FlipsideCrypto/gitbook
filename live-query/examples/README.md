# Examples

LiveQuery supports two categories of functions: **EVM Functions** and **API Functions**.&#x20;

**API functions** act as foundational elements that permit you to query any API and import the results into Flipside.&#x20;

**EVM functions**, on the other hand, are specially designed for blockchain networks compatible with EVM and are represented as a layer of abstraction above the API functions.
