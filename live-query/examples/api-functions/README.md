# ðŸ¤– API Functions

API functions serve as a low-level primitive that enables you to query any API (or Node RPC) and bring those results into Flipside. This is particularly useful for 3rd Party Data APIs or blockchain nodes/networks not yet supported by higher-level functions such as our EVM Functions.

### **API Function Examples**

{% content-ref url="query-thegraph.md" %}
[query-thegraph.md](query-thegraph.md)
{% endcontent-ref %}
