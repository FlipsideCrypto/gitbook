# NEAR Tables

The data models for NEAR have been updated to use the [Near Lake S3 Bucket](https://docs.near.org/tools/realtime#near-lake-indexer), which is the same data source that feeds NEAR's explorer, as of January 23rd, 2023. The core views available to Flipside data users remain the exact same, but the below linked documentation may be a bit cumbersome until the legacy models are fully deleted. If using the lineage graph, [apply a filter on the tag `s3_load`](https://flipsidecrypto.github.io/near-models/#!/overview?g\_v=1\&g\_i=%2Btag:s3\_load%2B%20%2Btag:api%2B) to exclude legacy models. Further, deprecated models have been moved to `models/silver/legacy/` to keep them out of sight.
