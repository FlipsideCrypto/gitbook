# Asset Transfer Transaction

This is a table for all transactions whose type is Asset Transfer. This is when an asset is transferred from one wallet to another. Visit here for more details: [ ](https://developer.algorand.org/docs/get-details/transactions/transactions/#asset-configuration-transaction)[https://developer.algorand.org/docs/get-details/transactions/transactions/#asset-transfer-transaction](https://developer.algorand.org/docs/get-details/transactions/transactions/#asset-transfer-transaction)

## Table Schema

All transactions have a distinct intra and block\_id combination. The intra is the transaction # into the block where the transaction was confirmed. Inner transactions(flagged with the inner tx flag) share the tx id of their parent application transactions so you can tie inner transaction to a parent transaction via a tx id. The inner transactions are seen as distinct transactions on the Algorand blockchain, which is signified by their intra and block id combination. One other note on the parent transactions, the parent transaction of inner transaction do not summarize the inner transactions and are seen as their own distinct transaction, which is usually an application call transaction.&#x20;
