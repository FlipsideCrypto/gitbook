* **Adding Widgets:** Click the "Widget" button in the side navigation to view all available panel types.
* **Editing Content:** To make changes to any panel on your dashboard, simply click on the panel to open its Settings/Styles panel.
  * The Settings tab allows you to edit the content within each panel. You can:
    * Modify visualization settings for charts.
    * Edit content within text boxes.
    * Update image sources used in the panel.
  * The Styles tab is where you can customize the visual design of your dashboard.

### Introducing New features&#x20;

* **New Widget: Layouts!** Use this widget to group relevant charts, text boxes, and images together to create a clear and organized information hierarchy. This is especially powerful since parameters are now specific to individual layouts!
*   **Scoped Parameters:** parameters are now specific to individual layouts, ensuring your audiences know exactly which visualizations the parameters apply to.&#x20;

*   **Streamlined Workflow:** you can now directly edit the details of any chart within the dashboard builder itself. This eliminates the need to jump back and forth between the chart builder and the dashboard.&#x20;
