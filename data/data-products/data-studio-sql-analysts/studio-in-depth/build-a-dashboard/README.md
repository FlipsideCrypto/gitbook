#### **New UX pattern with the dual panel builder**

* **The panel on the left: Widgets/Layout**&#x20;
  * **The Widgets tab** is your one-stop shop for adding new panels to your dashboard. Browse through the available widgets and existing charts, and simply click to add them and populate your dashboard.
  * **The Layout tab** is a tree view of all the panels within your dashboard. For ease of navigation, you can click in the tree to navigate directly to a specific panel. This functionality is particularly useful for managing complex dashboards.
* **The panel on the right: Settings/Styles Panel**&#x20;
  * **The Settings tab** is where you edit the content within each panel. This includes modifying visualization settings, text content within text boxes, and image sources.
  * **The Styles tab** is where you unleash your design creativity! This includes all the controls you need to customize the visual appearance of your dashboard. Edit background colors, chart styles, text formatting, and more.

### Introducing New features&#x20;

**New Widget: Layouts!** Use this widget to group relevant charts, text boxes, and images together to create a clear and organized information hierarchy. This is especially powerful since parameters are now specific to individual layouts!

**Scoped Parameters:** parameters are now specific to individual layouts, ensuring your audiences know exactly which visualizations the parameters apply to.&#x20;

**Streamlined Workflow:** you can now directly edit the details of any chart within the dashboard builder itself. This eliminates the need to jump back and forth between the chart builder and the dashboard,
