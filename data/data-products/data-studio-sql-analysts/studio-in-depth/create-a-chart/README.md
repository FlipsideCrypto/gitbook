# Create a Chart

Charts remain a central part of data visualization and they now reside in their own dedicated tab. Click on the big "+" button next to the query tab to launch the new chart builder! The brand new charting library empowers you to completely customize every aspect of your dashboards, transforming data into visually compelling narratives.

#### **Supported Chart types and when to use them:**

* **Table**: Present your data in a clear and concise tabular format. Useful for displaying detailed information, comparisons, or raw data sets.
* **Bar**: Ideal for comparing categories or showing changes over time.&#x20;
* **Horizontal Bar**: A bar chart rotated on its side, useful for emphasizing long category labels or showcasing comparisons across many categories.
* **Big Number**: quite simply: when you want to show just one number.
* **Bar Line**: ideal for visualizing both categories and trends within those categories.
* **Area**: when comparing quantities over time (or proportions of a whole over time).&#x20;
* **Pie**: when you need to show the share of a set of constituent parts relative to the whole, and only then (e.g., % of NFTs minted in a collection that have been held vs. sold).&#x20;
* **Scatter**: when comparing independent variables or sets of numbers, and when you think there's likely to be some relationship between them (e.g., time vs. nft sale prices vs gas prices); a great choice for exploring complex or multi-dimensional data before committing to an approach.
* **Line**: when you want to visualize a trend, or movement in some measure, over time, and especially when the dimension measures are evenly spaced (like: a value exists for every week, day or hour â€” price charts or rates are good examples of this, vs. transactions which are more sporadic).

Note: While adding "Table" as a chart type brings exciting customization options, it does introduce a slight change in workflow compared to the previous version. To include a table in your dashboard, you'll now need to first create a "Table" chart and customize it within the chart builder.&#x20;

#### **Unmatched Customization**

For the ultimate power users, click next to dive into the chart's JSON object for complete control. This advanced editing mode allows granular customization of every visual aspect, from colors and fonts to intricate chart behaviors.
