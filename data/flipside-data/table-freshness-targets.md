# Table Freshness Targets

Flipside's tables target the following latency schedule from Chain Head. The following can be tuned based on use cases/needs. Please reach out if you have a specific use case that requires a latency closer to the chain head and our team would be happy to discuss solutions with you.

Flipside refreshes data across three dimensions: `fact` tables, `dim` tables, and `ez` tables.
