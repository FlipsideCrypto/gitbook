# Flipside Growth MCP

### What This Is

Flipside Growth Intelligence is an AI-powered blockchain analytics system that helps you understand, optimize, and grow blockchain ecosystems. Instead of wrestling with complex data queries, you simply ask questions in plain English and get data-driven insights, strategic recommendations, and actionable growth plans.

### What You Can Do

#### üîç Ecosystem Health Analysis

Ask questions like:

* "How healthy is the Ethereum ecosystem right now?"
* "Which Layer 2 has the highest quality users?"
* "Is Base growing faster than Arbitrum?"

You'll get: Current metrics, trend analysis, competitive comparisons, and context about what the numbers mean for growth.

#### üë• User Quality & Behavior Insights

Ask questions like:

* "What makes users stick around on Polygon?"
* "Why are we losing users on Avalanche?"
* "Which protocols create the most loyal users?"

You'll get: User quality analysis using Flipside's proprietary 0-15 scoring system, retention patterns, and behavioral insights that explain what drives user engagement.

#### üìà Growth Strategy & Optimization

Ask questions like:

* "How can we improve user retention on our chain?"
* "What's the best way to attract high-value users?"
* "Should we focus on NFTs or DeFi for growth?"

You'll get: Custom growth playbooks, strategic recommendations based on successful patterns from other ecosystems, and specific tactics with expected outcomes.

#### üèÜ Competitive Intelligence

Ask questions like:

* "How does our protocol compare to Uniswap?"
* "Which blockchain is winning the gaming sector?"
* "What can we learn from Optimism's success?"

You'll get: Detailed benchmarking, best practice identification, and insights into what's working (or not working) across the industry.

#### üìä Custom Analysis & Reports

Ask for things like:

* "Create a comprehensive DeFi report for our investors"
* "Analyze the impact of our recent token launch"
* "Build a dashboard for tracking our ecosystem KPIs"

You'll get: Professional reports with visualizations, executive summaries, and actionable recommendations tailored to your specific needs.

### How It Works

#### The Magic Behind the Scenes

* 35+ Blockchain Coverage: Real-time data from all major chains
* Flipside Scores: Proprietary 0-15 user quality ratings that predict behavior
* Growth Science: Proven frameworks based on analyzing billions of transactions
* Expert Knowledge: Built-in expertise across protocols, chains, and market dynamics

#### Just Ask Natural Questions

You don't need to know SQL, understand database schemas, or learn complex tools. Just ask what you want to know:

‚ùå Don't worry about: "SELECT COUNT(\*) FROM ethereum.defi.ez\_dex\_swaps WHERE..." ‚úÖ Just ask: "How much DEX trading happened on Ethereum last week?"

### Getting Started

#### Start Simple

Try asking broad questions first:

* "What's happening in DeFi right now?"
* "How is \[your blockchain] performing?"
* "What are the biggest trends in crypto?"

#### Then Get Specific

Based on what you learn, drill deeper:

* "Why is that protocol doing so well?"
* "How can we replicate that success?"
* "What would happen if we launched something similar?"

#### Focus on Outcomes

Think about what decisions you need to make:

* Growing your ecosystem
* Improving user retention
* Launching new features
* Allocating resources
* Planning roadmaps

### What Makes This Different

#### Quality Over Quantity

Most analytics focus on transaction counts and TVL. We focus on user quality - identifying users who stick around, contribute value, and drive real growth.

#### Predictive Insights

Our Flipside Scores help predict which users will churn, which will become power users, and what interventions actually work.

#### Strategic Context

You don't just get numbers - you get strategic interpretation, competitive context, and actionable recommendations.

#### Cross-Chain Intelligence

Compare and learn from patterns across 28+ blockchains. See what works on Ethereum and how to adapt it for Solana.

### Example Conversations

#### Ecosystem Health Check

You: "How is Base doing compared to other L2s?" System: Analyzes user quality, growth trends, protocol adoption, and provides detailed comparison with Arbitrum, Optimism, and Polygon, highlighting Base's strengths and opportunities

#### Growth Strategy

You: "We're launching a new DeFi protocol on Avalanche. What should we focus on?" System: Reviews successful DeFi launches on Avalanche, analyzes user behavior patterns, identifies key success factors, and provides a custom launch strategy with specific tactics and expected outcomes

#### Troubleshooting

You: "Our users aren't sticking around after trying our protocol. Why?" System: Analyzes user journey data, identifies drop-off points, compares with successful protocols, and provides specific recommendations to improve retention

### Tips for Best Results

#### Be Specific About Your Goals

Instead of: "Tell me about Ethereum" Try: "How can we attract more DeFi users to our Ethereum protocol?"

#### Ask Follow-Up Questions

The system gets smarter as you engage:

* "Why is that happening?"
* "How does that compare to competitors?"
* "What would you recommend we do about it?"

#### Think About Your Audience

Mention who needs the information:

* "Create an investor update on our ecosystem growth"
* "Give me talking points for our community call"
* "What should our dev team prioritize next?"

#### Request Specific Formats

* "Create a one-page executive summary"
* "Give me a detailed analysis with charts"
* "Make a simple list of action items"

### What You Can Expect

#### Immediate Value

Get insights and recommendations right away, even for complex questions about blockchain ecosystems and user behavior.

#### Data-Driven Decisions

Every recommendation comes with supporting data, trend analysis, and confidence levels so you can make informed choices.

#### Strategic Context

Understand not just what's happening, but why it matters and what successful ecosystems do differently.

#### Actionable Outcomes

Get specific next steps, not just analysis. Know exactly what to do to improve your ecosystem's growth.

### Understanding Flipside Scores

#### The 0-15 User Quality Scale

Flipside Scores rate wallet quality based on on-chain behavior patterns:

* 0-3 (Inactive/New): Minimal engagement, high churn risk
  * Typical: New wallets, one-time transactions, dormant users
* 4-7 (Active): Regular engagement, moderate value contribution
  * Typical: Regular swaps, basic DeFi usage, consistent activity
* 8-15 (Power Users): High engagement, governance participation, complex interactions
  * Typical: LP provision, governance voting, multi-protocol usage

#### Why Score 4 Matters

Score 4 represents a critical inflection point. Users who reach this level are:

* 10x more likely to remain active long-term
* 5x more valuable in terms of transaction volume
* 3x more likely to participate in governance
* Primary drivers of ecosystem network effects

#### Score-Based Growth Strategy

* Acquisition Focus: Get users from 0 ‚Üí 1 (first meaningful interaction)
* Activation Priority: Move users from 1 ‚Üí 4+ (the retention threshold)
* Retention Optimization: Help score 4+ users become power users (8+)

#### Supported Blockchains for Scoring

EVM: Ethereum, Polygon, Arbitrum, Optimism, Base, Avalanche, BSC, Fantom Non-EVM: Solana, NEAR, Aptos, Sei, Flow, Stellar Emerging: Eclipse, BOB, Ink, Mantle, Aleo, and 15+ others
