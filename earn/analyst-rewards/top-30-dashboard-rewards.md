# ✨Top 30✨ Dashboard Rewards

Top 30 is a new rendition on [Flipside's Top 8 Dashboard Rewards](top-8-dashboard-rewards.md) program.&#x20;

**Please note: this program is in Beta testing, and is subject to change!**

{% hint style="info" %}
**The Top 30 Program will run during January 2024**
{% endhint %}

TLDR; make dashboards in our app, publish and promote them, and if your dashboard spends time in the Top 30 you get paid.&#x20;

Here's how it works:

The trending dashboard rankings on our the [Discover page](https://flipsidecrypto.xyz/discover) are based on:

👍 likes on our website\
📈 social media engagement and shares across various platforms\
👀 views/website engagement\
🌐 shares across the web\
🤫 other factors

## Earn Rewards

Base rewards are assigned based on a dashboard's rank on [Flipside's trending page](https://flipsidecrypto.xyz/discover?d\_sort=trending).

<table><thead><tr><th width="450">Dashboard Rank</th><th>Base Reward</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td>1-10</td><td>$1.50/hr</td></tr><tr><td>11-30</td><td>$1/hr</td></tr></tbody></table>

## Claim Rewards

Rewards are claimable on an hourly basis and are sent to the addresses set in `Manage Addresses` under the gear icon dropdown. Pending rewards are available on [Flipside Earn](https://flipsidecrypto.xyz/earn).
