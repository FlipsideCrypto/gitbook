# Top Dashboard Guidelines

Top Dashboard Guidelines enable Flipside community analytics to be a source of truth for relevant blockchain data insights. We hope they inspire you to make your best contributions to this space!

They also help us fairly reward your valuable analytical contributions. Peer reviewers regularly evaluate Top Dashboards to implement these guidelines.&#x20;

Dashboards can be disqualified from participating in Earn rewards at the teamâ€™s discretion without notice.  Repeated and/or severe violations of these guidelines will also disqualify a user from earning analytics rewards in the future.&#x20;

## 1. Accuracy

* Put in your best effort to create accurate analytics.&#x20;
* Compare your results with other trusted data sources.
* Understand and resolve discrepancies.&#x20;
* Stay open to feedback on your methodology. Check your dashboard comment section for feedback from our peer **review network**!&#x20;
* Incorporate feedback to make your analysis more rigorous.&#x20;
* When unsure about methodology, leverage the collective mind of our [Discord](https://discord.gg/ZmU3jQuu6W) community. Bring your work there to ask questions and request feedback.
* Be the source of truth for the metrics you build.

## 2. Relevance

* Contribute to current web3 public discourse with topical and in-demand data insights.
* To help you stay up to date, we built data science-powered tools that spotlight ðŸ”—[**Trending Topics**](https://science.flipsidecrypto.xyz/trending/) and ðŸ”—[**Trending Tweets**](https://science.flipsidecrypto.xyz/trending-tweets/) in web3. Check out these tools to find your next analysis topic!&#x20;

## 3. Use of Flipside data and tooling

* Use Flipside data tables and other Flipside data products in your dashboard to a meaningful extent.&#x20;
* _Very occasionally, you can request an exception ahead of time from the Community and Moderator team on Discord. Exceptions are not guaranteed._

## 4. Building on the work of others & giving credit

* [**ðŸ‘‰ How to use others' work? Don't plagiarize, give credit instead. ðŸ‘ˆ**](https://flipsidecrypto.xyz/piper/how-to-use-other-s-work-don-t-plagiarize-give-credit-instead...-9_Vyj1)  Read this â€“ it summarizes the **minimum expectations** you must follow when you **use and cite** (all or part of) **the work of others**.
* You can leverage othersâ€™ past analytics as your starting point, then add your original contributions.
* Do not simply copy someone else's work without giving them credit or adding your own value. **You are always required to cite the author** appropriately, and **add something meaningful of your own** instead of just copying or changing small things. Otherwise your work will be **disqualified from rewards.**&#x20;
* _See a dashboard that copies others' analysis without giving credit to the source and without adding oneâ€™s own value and ideas? Let us know on Discord._

## 5. Building in public

* To be eligible for rewards, make sure your queries are set to Public, so that our community and team can verify accuracy and originality.&#x20;
* _Very occasionally, you can request an exception ahead of time from the Community and Moderator team on Discord. Exceptions are not guaranteed._

## 6. Genuine engagement

* Share your analysis with a **genuine, human web3 audience** that is interested in your insights.
* Avoid purchasing or otherwise encouraging inorganic impressions.
* Do not use duplicate or sybil accounts on Flipside, X (formerly Twitter), or other platforms to attempt to gain an unfair advantage in our Earn program.&#x20;
* _See a dashboard or post that benefits from non-genuine engagement? Let us know on Discord._

## 7. T\&C and Professionalism

* **Remain professional and respectful** in all analytics you build, all content you create, and all public and private communication with our community and team members. To be eligible for rewards you must always comply with Flipside Terms and Conditions, and ensure that your content and public presence reflect the same spirit. Outputs and users can be disqualified from rewards for these and other reasons at Flipside's discretion.

## Troubleshooting

* **Is your dashboard trending on X but is not** [**picked up**](https://science.flipsidecrypto.xyz/flipside_analysts/) **by our data pipeline?** [**Submit it here**](https://science.flipsidecrypto.xyz/missing-tweet/) so it's picked up automatically. It takes up to 2 hours for your submission to take effect.
* **Do we** [**have all the raw data**](https://science.flipsidecrypto.xyz/flipside_analysts/) **about your dashboard and tweet, but you think it should rank higher on the leaderboard?** Updates to the Top Dashboards algorithm took effect on November 1, 2024. There are [many factors](https://docs.flipsidecrypto.xyz/earn/analyst-rewards/top-dashboards#how-it-works) that determine ranks, in addition to total impressions on X.&#x20;
  * _**We appreciate reports of missing data and do our best to reconcile them. But if all data is ingested correctly, our team cannot address rank questions, because of the number of factors involved.**_
