# Top Dashboards

## How It Works

Make dashboards in our app, publish and promote them, and if your dashboard trends in Top Dashboards you get paid.

Trending dashboard rankings on our [**Insights**](https://flipsidecrypto.xyz/insights/dashboards) page are based on:

👍 likes on our website\
📈 social media engagement and shares across X and Warpcast\
👀 views/website engagement\
🌐 shares across the web\
🤫 other factors

## Earn Rewards

Rewards are assigned based on a dashboard's rank on [**Flipside's trending insights page**](https://flipsidecrypto.xyz/insights/dashboards) and the League the analyst is in.

To be eligible, dashboards must follow [**Top Dashboard Guidelines**](https://docs.flipsidecrypto.xyz/earn/analyst-rewards/top-dashboards/top-dashboard-guidelines).

### Gold League

Gold League represents the highest quality trending insights by our community.&#x20;

| Gold League Dashboard Rank | Reward     |
| -------------------------- | ---------- |
| 1-10                       | $1.50/hour |
| 11-40                      | $1/hour    |

### Silver League

Silver League is an opportunity to earn while you learn. As a newer or upskilling analyst, you can earn rewards without the pressure of competing with Gold League dashboards.&#x20;

Silver League includes accounts created less than 3 months ago, accounts with <10 hours in the Gold League, and accounts added to Silver League for accelerated upskilling.&#x20;

The maximum duration of being eligible is 3 months. It is possible to advance to Gold League at any point, or at the end of this period. Advancing is based on the strength of the Peer Reviews of your outputs that our experienced community Reviewers continuously conduct, and also on not violating [**Top Dashboard Guidelines**](https://docs.flipsidecrypto.xyz/earn/analyst-rewards/top-dashboards/top-dashboard-guidelines).

| Silver League Dashboard Rank | Reward     |
