# Top Dashboards

## How It Works

Make dashboards in our app, publish and promote them, and if your dashboard trends in Top Dashboards you get paid. Maximize your rewards by creating relevant, interesting data-driven content that is in demand in web3 ecosystems.&#x20;

Trending dashboard rankings on our [**Insights**](https://flipsidecrypto.xyz/insights/dashboards) page are based on:

üìçengaging with key voices and core audiences in an ecosystem\
üìà social media engagement and shares across X and Warpcast\
üëÄ views/website engagement\
üåê organic shares across relevant web3 ecosystems\
ü§´ other factors

## Earn Rewards

Rewards are assigned based on a dashboard's rank on [**Flipside's trending insights page**](https://flipsidecrypto.xyz/insights/dashboards).

To be eligible, dashboards must follow [**Top Dashboard Guidelines**](https://docs.flipsidecrypto.xyz/earn/analyst-rewards/top-dashboards/top-dashboard-guidelines).

### Top Dashboards

Top Dashboards represent the highest quality trending insights by our community.&#x20;

Top Dashboards will be evaluated for quality, accuracy, and originality, and **rewards can be adjusted at the team's discretion**. This applies to all 50 spots, but especially to Top 10.

_(As of November 2024, there are no separate leagues and everyone competes on one leaderboard. Silver League is currently on pause, instead everyone who follows the above Guidelines is eligible to rank on the same leaderboard.)_

| Dashboard Rank | Reward      |
| -------------- | ----------- |
| **1-5**        | **$3/hour** |
| **6-10**       | **$2/hour** |
| 11-15          | $1.50/hour  |
| 16-20          | $1/hour     |
| 21-30          | $0.75/hour  |
| 31-40          | $0.50/hour  |
| 41-50          | $0.25/hour  |

### Boosts

Boosts are limited-time reward multipliers that apply to Top Dashboards on certain ecosystems or topics during specific time periods.&#x20;

The best way to participate in a Boost is to uncover a **relevant, interesting, timely narrative** happening at that time in a boosted ecosystem. Recap dashboards (weekly, monthly, and other stats), template dashboards, and others that don't bring timely and interesting insights can be disqualified from rewards.&#x20;

To find out what boosts are currently active and coming up:&#x20;

* follow our updates on X (Twitter) [**@flipsidecrypto**](https://twitter.com/flipsidecrypto)
* check our [**Discord**](https://discord.gg/flipside) #announcements channel
* visit this month's leaderboard (link on the [**homepage**](https://flipsidecrypto.xyz/)).

### Decay

New insights that are relevant to current topics in web3 take precedence. A decay function gradually reduces rewards on older Top Dashboards, although it never takes rewards to 0 if the dashboard is still eligible for earning.&#x20;

### Timeouts and Bans

Dashboards and users who violate [**Top Dashboard Guidelines**](https://docs.flipsidecrypto.xyz/flipside-community/community-analytics-guidelines) or do not meet quality expectations are disqualified from rewards temporarily or permanently without notice.  _**Our Community and Moderator team will not be able to comment on specific instances of disqualification.**_

## Claim Rewards

Rewards are claimable on an hourly basis in [**Flipside Earn**](../../../choose-your-flipside-plan/).&#x20;

Start by adding a wallet address to your Flipside account on the chain where you accrued rewards. To do this, go to your Account dropdown (upper right corner of our [**homepage**](https://flipsidecrypto.xyz/)) and click `Add a Wallet.`
