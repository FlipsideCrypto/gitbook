# Quests

## Introduction

Flipside Quests are a gamified onchain experience designed to encourage users to explore, learn, and engage with various blockchain ecosystems while earning rewards. By participating in quests, users can improve their onchain scores, which in turn increases their potential earnings.\
\
Flipside Quests are tailored for crypto users who are eager to deepen their knowledge of blockchain technologies and earn rewards. The ideal users are crypto enthusiasts who are curious, motivated to learn, and keen on earning crypto rewards.

## Features

* **Multi-Chain Quests**: Users can participate in quests across different blockchain ecosystems such as Near, Aptos, Avalanche, Flow, Solana, and Axelar. More chains will be added over time.
* **Onchain Scores**: Your wallets will each have their own respective score for each chain we support. From 0-15, based on your onchain actions, a score will be assigned to you that represents your engagement level for that chain. &#x20;
* **Reward Tiers**: Each quest offers varying rewards based on the user's onchain score. For example, a user with a score of 0-3 might earn $1 per quest, while a user with a score of 5+ could earn $5 for the same quest.
* **Claim Limits**: Each quest has a limited number of claims, which are distributed across different score buckets. For instance, the 0-3 score bucket might have a different claim limit compared to the 7+ score bucket.
* [**Wallet Management**](../wallet-management.md): Users need to connect their web3 wallets to participate in quests. Flipside supports wallets for the respective chains where quests are available. Flipside will associate each connected wallet to your core Flipside account.
* **Rewards Center**: Users can claim their earned rewards from the Rewards Center. Rewards are usually paid out in the native token of the chain the quest was completed. In some cases, rewards are paid out in USDC.
