# ðŸ¥‡ Leaderboard & Rewards

Players compete to earn a portion of a $150,000 prize pool by accumulating points and advancing through various club levels.

Every club level provides 2 ways to earn:

1. A guaranteed minimum payout&#x20;
2. A chance in a lottery to earn a level-specific reward

### Reward Tiers

Below is a detailed breakdown of the reward structure across the different club levels:

<table><thead><tr><th width="184">Club Level</th><th width="97">Players</th><th width="173">Guaranteed (min)</th><th width="154">Lottery Winners</th><th>Lottery (max)</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td><strong>Diamond</strong> </td><td>3</td><td>$10,000 </td><td>1</td><td>$5,000</td></tr><tr><td><strong>Platinum</strong> </td><td>10</td><td>$3,500 </td><td>2</td><td>$2,500 </td></tr><tr><td><strong>Gold</strong> </td><td>32</td><td>$1,000 </td><td>5</td><td>$1,500 </td></tr><tr><td><strong>Silver</strong> </td><td>70</td><td>$500 </td><td>0</td><td>$0</td></tr><tr><td><strong>Bronze</strong> </td><td>5</td><td>$100 </td><td>0</td><td>$0</td></tr></tbody></table>

### Leveling Up

There are two benefits to leveling up throughout the game:

1. Higher guaranteed minimum payouts
2. Access to a larger lottery payout. The number of lottery winners varies by level (the more people in the level, the more lottery winners; see the table above for more details).

### Announcing Winners

At the conclusion of the game, a one-week review period will take place. The Flipside team will review the rankings to ensure no rules were violated. Any players who violate the rules or behave in a manner not in the spirit of the game will be disqualified.

We will then conduct the lottery at each level and winners will be announced and revealed on the [leaderboard](https://flipsidecrypto.xyz/grail/aptos/s1/leaderboard).&#x20;

### Payouts

After the final winners have been announced, payouts will be available to all players for withdrawal in the[ Flipside Reward Center](https://flipsidecrypto.xyz/earn).&#x20;
