# Example Code

### 1. Query Pagination

All queries can return a maximum of 1GB of data. The entire query result set is saved in accordance with the queryâ€™s TTL. Subsets of the query results can be retrieved by specifying the page size and page number. All without re-running the initial query and incurring `query_second` usage.

By default, all query runs will be set to the following if pagination is not specified.

| variable   | default value |
| ---------- | ------------- |
| pageSize   | 100k          |
| pageNumber | 1             |

#### Examples:

{% tabs %}
{% tab title="Python" %}
In this query, we will request 200k records from the `ethereum.core.ez_nft_mints` table and return 100 records, starting at page #1.

```python
from flipside import Flipside

sdk = Flipside("<YOUR_API_KEY>")

# Create a query object for the `query.run` function to execute
# with a page size of 100 rows, starting with page #1.
sql = """
  SELECT
    nft_address,
    mint_price_eth,
    mint_price_usd
  FROM ethereum.core.ez_nft_mints
  LIMIT 200000
"""

# Run the query on Flipside's Query Engine and await the results...
# This SDK function will call `createQueryRun` and poll `getQueryRun` of 
# the Flipside RPC API
page_1_results = sdk.query(
  sql,
  page_size=100,
  page_number=1
)
```

Now if we'd like to access page #2, simply set the `page_number` argument to 2 and re-run the query. This will return the next 100 rows (since we had set the `page_size` to 100).&#x20;

```python
# call `get_query_results` update the page_number to the second page
# This SDK function will call the `getQueryRunResults` method on the Flipside 
# RPC API
page2_results = sdk.get_query_results(
    page_1_results.query_id,
    page_number=2,
    page_size=100
)
```

To retrieve all the results, run the following code:

```python
i = 0
page_number = 1
page_size = 1000
all_rows = []
while i < results.run_stats.record_count:
    results = sdk.get_query_results(
        results.query_id, 
        page_number=page_number, 
        page_size=page_size
    )
    all_rows.append(results.rows)

    i += page_size
    page_number += 1
```
{% endtab %}
{% endtabs %}
