# ðŸš¦ Rate Limits

Every account has a limit of 15 concurrent query runs. This means you cannot run more than 15 queries at the same time across all your API keys. This rate limit is in place to protect query spamming (_whether accidental or intentional_) for the benefit of all API/SDK users. _Need a higher concurrency limit? Reach out to us directly and we can work with you._&#x20;
