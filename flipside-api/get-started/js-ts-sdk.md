# 🏗 JS/TS SDK

{% hint style="info" %}
I_n May of 2023, Flipside released V2 of its API that enables faster, and more reliable querying that scales with your usage. We are currently upgrading the existing SDKs to be compatible with the V2 API. The Javascript/Typescript SDK is currently undergoing an upgrade and will be available soon._



_**For Legacy ShroomDK users only:** in the meantime, you can still access the existing JS/TS SDK. Once the upgrade is complete you will be able to seamlessly upgrade to the latest version of the SDK without any changes to your existing code._
