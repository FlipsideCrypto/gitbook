### Important Things to Know

* All our data is accessible via SQL queries, and you'll use the [Snowflake SQL](our-data/using-snowflake-sql.md) dialect to access it.
* Our core app is brand new (launched Feb 2023) and some [documentation](our-app/app-overview.md) is available ‚Äî we're actively building this out, including both text and video content ‚Äî if you have questions that aren't answered here, please reach out in [Discord](https://discord.gg/ZmU3jQuu6W).
* Our data structures are and designed for ease of use and efficient querying, and are  [extensively documented](our-data/data-table-documentation.md). We regularly update our data structures to optimize efficiency.
* Latency varies from table to table, but typically lags either 1 hour or 1 day, at most.
* If you run into difficulty getting your queries to run, we provide [a guide for efficient query writing](our-data/writing-efficient-queries.md). Need more assistance? Get help anytime in our [Discord](https://discord.gg/ZmU3jQuu6W).

### What blockchains and projects does Flipside have data on?

If it happens on-chain, we've got it.&#x20;

Data include core tables (blocks, events, transactions) for every chain, with added 'easy' tables (swaps, prices, etc.) and project-specific tables modeled by the Flipside community.

See our [Data Table Documentation](our-data/data-table-documentation.md) for a current list of supported chains. Don‚Äôt see the chain you‚Äôre looking for? We add new chains regularly, but you can drop a request in our [Discord](https://discord.gg/ZmU3jQuu6W) anytime.
